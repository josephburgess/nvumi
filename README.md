# nvumi

**nvumi** is a Neovim plugin that integrates the [numi](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi) natural language calculator with [Snacks.nvim's](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/scratch.md) scratch buffer. It lets you type out natural language expressions and see the results inline.

## Installation

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "josephburgess/nvumi",
  dependencies = { "folke/snacks.nvim" },
  opts = {
    virtual_text = "newline", -- or "inline"
    prefix = "= ", -- prefix shown before the virtual text output
    keys = {
      run = "<CR>", -- run/refresh calculations
      reset = "R", -- reset buffer
      yank = "<leader>y", -- yank last output
    },
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Run the command `:Nvumi` to open a scratch buffer ready for calculations

2. Type your natural language expression(s) (e.g., `20 inches in cm`) in insert mode

3. The answer(s) to your expressions will render in the buffer.

4. Press `<CR>` (Enter) in normal mode and the buffer will re-run all calculations/refresh. Useful if using lots of variables/complicated logic to have a clean slate.

5. Pressing `<leader>y` will yank the latest evaluation to the clipboard

## Variable Assignment

nvumi now supports variable assignment, allowing you to store specific numbers, or evaluated results and reuse them in later calculations.

</p>

**How It Works:**

- **Assigning a Variable:**
  In your scratch buffer, type an assignment in the format:

  ```text
  variable_name = expression
  ```

  You can assign a variable either to a numerical value or to an evaluated expression, for example:

  ```text
  x = 20 inches in cm
  y = 5000
  ```

  In the first example, nvumi evaluates the expression (`20 inches in cm`) and stores its result in the variable `x`.
  In the second, `y` simply holds the number `5000` without any further evaluation.

- **Using Variables in Expressions:**
  Once assigned, you can reference variables in other calculations:

  ```text
  x * y
  x + 5
  y meters in kilometers
  ```

  nvumi will substitute the variable with its stored value before evaluation.

- **Resetting Variables:**
  Using the `<reset>` command clears both the buffer and all stored variables.

ðŸ’¡ _Tip:_ Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores.

### **Yank output**

More features! You can yank the last evaluated result to your system clipboard using:

- Default keybind: **`<leader>y`**

## Virtual Text Locations

Currently you can configure where you want the virtual text to be displayed, `inline` or `newline`:

## Requirements

- **[numi-cli](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi):**
  Install it using:

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://s.numi.app/cli | sh
  ```

  Or with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

  ```bash
  brew install nikolaeu/numi/numi-cli
  ```

## Contributing

This is my first attempt at a Neovim plugin, so contributions are more than welcome! If you encounter issues or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.

## Planned Features & Roadmap

A few things I'm thinking about adding as I continue trying to expand my knowledge of `lua` and plugin development:

- [x] Assigning answers to variables
- [x] Custom prefixes/suffixes for results (e.g., `=` `â†’` ðŸš€ etc).
- [x] Auto-evaluate expressions as you type without need to press `<CR>`
- [x] Yankable answers!
  - [ ] Stretch: make possible for all evaluations (currently only last output is yankable)
- [ ] Ability to call numi/evaluate expressions on a line in _any_ buffer on demand
- [ ] Fine-tuning dates, times, and unit formatting
- [ ] Additional conversions not currently possible with numi (possibly live prices for currency etc)

- **[Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim):**
  Thanks @folke for the incredible plugin. The `lua` code runner built into the Scratch buffer inspired this idea in the first place. Thanks also also for your super-human contributions to the community in general!
- **[numi](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi):**
  Thanks for providing an amazing natural language calculator.
