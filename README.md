# nvumi

**nvumi** is a Neovim plugin that integrates the [numi](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi) natural language calculator with [Snacks.nvim's](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/scratch.md) scratch buffer. It lets you type out natural language expressions and see the results inline.

## Installation

### Using Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "josephburgess/nvumi",
  dependencies = { "folke/snacks.nvim" },
  opts = {
    virtual_text = "newline", -- or "inline"
    keys = {
      run = "<CR>", -- run calculations
      reset = "R", -- reset buffer
    },
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Run the command `:Nvumi` to open a scratch buffer ready for calculations

2. Type your natural language expression(s) (e.g., `20 inches in cm`) in insert mode

3. Press `<CR>` (Enter) in normal mode and the buffer will attempt to evaluate all non-empty, non-commented lines at once

4. Running the command `:help nvumi` opens the manual

## Configuration

Currently you can configure where you want the virtual text to be displayed, `inline` or `newline`:

## Contributing

This is my first attempt at a Neovim plugin, so contributions are more than welcome! If you encounter issues or have ideas for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.

## Planned Features & Roadmap

A few things I'm thinking about adding as I continue trying to expand my knowledge of `lua` and plugin development:

- [ ] Assigning answers to variables
- [ ] Auto-evaluate expressions as you type
- [ ] Yankable answers!
- [ ] Ability to call numi/evaluate expressions anywhere (not just in the scratch buffer)
- [ ] Fine-tuning dates, times, and unit formatting
- [ ] Custom prefixes/suffixes for results (e.g., `=, â†’` etc).
- [ ] Additional conversions not currently possible with numi (possibly live prices for currency etc)

## Acknowledgements

- **[Snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim):**
  Folke needs no introduction given his super-human contributions to the community. The `lua` code runner built into the Scratch buffer inspired this idea in the first place.
- **[numi](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi):**
  Thanks for providing an amazing natural language calculator.
