*nvumi*:  Natural language calculations in Neovim
===============================================

nvumi integrates the [numi-cli](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi) natural language
calculator with [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim). It provides a
scratch buffer where you can type natural language expressions and see the evaluated
results either inline or on a new line.

USAGE
-----

    `:Nvumi

    This command opens a scratch buffer where you can enter your
    calculations. In the scratch buffer:

      - Press <CR> (Enter) in normal mode to evaluate all non-empty lines.
      - Press "R" in normal mode to reset the buffer (clear all content).

CONFIGURATION
-------------

nvumi currently has one configuration option which determines where the calculated
results are displayed:

    virtual_text = "inline"  -- Display results at the end of the current line.
    virtual_text = "newline" -- Display results on a new line below each expression.

This is set during the plugin setup. For example, using Lazy.nvim:

>lua
    {
        "josephburgess/nvumi",
        dependencies = { "folke/snacks.nvim" },
        opts = {
            virtual_text = "inline" -- or "newline"
        }
    }
<

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- **numi-cli:** A natural language calculator.
  Install via: >bash
      curl -sSL https://s.numi.app/cli | sh
<
  or with Homebrew: >bash
      brew install nikolaeu/numi/numi-cli
<

- **snacks.nvim:** Used to create the scratch buffer.

EXAMPLES
--------

Type natural language expressions such as:

    20 inches in cm
    50 times 2
    25 GBP to EUR
    today + 8 weeks

and press <CR> to see the evaluated result. If configured as "inline", the result
will be appended to the line; if "newline", it will appear on a separate line.

See the numi-cli documentation for more about the expressions which are possible to evaluate.
