*nvumi*:  Natural language calculations in Neovim
===============================================

nvumi integrates the [numi-cli](https://github.com/nikolaeu/numi) natural language
calculator with [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim). It provides a
scratch buffer where you can type natural language expressions and see the evaluated
results either inline or on a new line.

USAGE
-----

    `:Nvumi

    This command opens a scratch buffer where you can enter your
    calculations. In the scratch buffer:

      - Expressions are automatically evaluated as you type.
      - Press `<CR>` (Enter) in normal mode to re-evaluate/refresh all non-empty lines.
      - Press `<R>` in normal mode to reset the buffer (clear all content).
      - Press `<leader>y` in normal mode to reset the buffer (clear all content).


VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT
-------------------

nvumi now supports assigning evaluated expressions to variables. This lets you reuse previously computed values in your calculations.

- To assign a variable, write a line in the form:

      variable_name = expression

  For example, typing:

      x = 2+2

  will evaluate `2+2` and store the result in `x`.

- To use the stored value, simply reference the variable in another expression:

      x * 3

  nvumi will substitute `x` with its stored result before evaluation.

- All variables are maintained for the current scratch session and are cleared when you use the `<reset>` command.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

nvumi currently supports the following configuration options:

    `virtual_text = "inline" | "newline"`  -- Where to display the results.
    `prefix = "= "` -- Choose the prefix shown before the virtual text

Keybinds:

    `keys.run`   -- Runs the calculations. Default: `<CR>`
    `keys.reset` -- Resets (clears) the buffer. Default: `R`
    `keys.yank`  -- Yanks the last evaluated result to the clipboard. Default: `<leader>y`

This is set during the plugin setup. For example, using Lazy.nvim:

>lua
  {
    "josephburgess/nvumi",
    dependencies = { "folke/snacks.nvim" },
      opts = {
	virtual_text = "inline", -- or "newline"
	prefix = "= ", -- prefix shown before the virtual text output
	keys = {
	  run = "<CR>", -- run all calculations
	  reset = "R", -- reset buffer
	  yank = "<leader>y", -- yank last output
	}
      }
  }

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- **numi-cli:** A natural language calculator.
  Install via: >bash
      curl -sSL https://s.numi.app/cli | sh
<
  or with Homebrew: >bash
      brew install nikolaeu/numi/numi-cli
<

- **snacks.nvim:** Used to create the scratch buffer.

EXAMPLES
--------
